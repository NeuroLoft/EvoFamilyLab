##  Concept

**EvoFamilyLab** offers a "Competence Passport" instead of a dating profile. We value:
1.  **Hard Skills:** Ability to build, grow food, engineer, create.
2.  **Soft Skills:** Communication, conflict resolution, teamwork.
3.  **Shared Vision:** Alignment on where and how to live (from Suburbs to Autonomous Estates).

Join us in building not just families, but **Lineages**.
